# 2048-Deep-Q-Learning
Implemented 2048 AI based on DeepMind Deep Q Learning.

High score: 13420

Configuration: Fully connected NN:
Layer 1: 16 nodes input vector
Layer 2: 64 nodes
Layer 3: 4 nodes (associated with 4 moves)

Due to lack of compute power I was not able to experiement as much as I wanted to. However I believe using a larger memory as well as more nodes in the hidden layer(possible multiple hidden layers), the score would definitely increase. 

I am looking to run this on an EC2 instance soon and will update the project.
